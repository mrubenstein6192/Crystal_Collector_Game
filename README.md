# Crystal_Collector_Game
##Description
The user will be given a random number to start the game.  By clicking on each of the four crystals and discovering their respective random values, the user must add the numbers up to achieve the random number.  

If the user goes over the target number, he/she loses and the game restarts with new random values for the crystals and a new random number to achieve.

If the user adds the crystals up exactly to the target, he/she wins and the game restarts with new random values.

##Issues
I began this activity with the layout, including the different images for each of the crystals.  As a result, the logic in my javascript has not been achieving what I expected.
